### Main subject

**What is the main subject?**

I want to understand to the humanity. If our nature is to be “good”, or it is destructive.


**Why am I not interested if this reality is true or not?**

Let's suppose that this world is a computer simulation or divine simulation, the only thing that I found interesting is if we can be free of these algorithms or pre-defined instructions. Otherwise, the life as I know will be obsolete because if this is a simulation. I could be stolen a bank or be a killer of killers. I could live around the world and have children with many women without be responsible for my children. Not only that, but I could commit suicide when I be boring of this life. I mean that in this scenario I am able to break the rules and the expectations of the society, going in the opposite direction of the survival instincts.


**Why is important for me understand the humanity?**

Well, I for sure that the other life species are significant as the same level as the humanity, we are the animals whose created these cities, and technology. The big difference is that the humanity has enough power to destroy, be cruel with other spices, be egoist and consume whatever that we need without take care other spices and environments. Maybe we will be conquest other planets, or we will be conquest by other races, maybe we will extinct our spice or the Terra. If it is not enough reason for me, I don't know what is a pure reason to invest time on this.
