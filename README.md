# Philosophy by Israel Roldan

[Español][Leeme]

Quick biography about why I think so that I have a good philosophy skills.

I consider myself as a good analyzer, maybe it is the reason of why I like to understand the software. In fact, when I was in high school and I tried to decide what career I'll choose, I was between medic focus on research or psychology and the obvious option software engineer. On this context at my 37 years old (2021) I assume my passion for try to understand the truth over anything.

In my ideals I have a big influence by Jesus Christ without the religious context. I was 8 years old when I watched a movie of this demigod. I was fascinated about the idea of a pure man who was helping and improve others without any personal interest, it is more as a mission. At this age I was experimenting the fight between the good and bad actions, kill cruelty some insects but tenderly caress my dog.

I have more to say, but it is better if I start with this project and explain all my ideas and references.
